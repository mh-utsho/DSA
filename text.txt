Steps to Resolve:
Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git fetch origin
Merge the changes into your local branch:

bash
Copy
Edit

git pull origin main --rebase

This ensures that your local branch is up-to-date with the remote before pushing.

Try pushing again:

bash
Copy
Edit

git push origin main

Alternative (Force Push - Only if Necessary)
If you are sure that your local changes should overwrite the remote, you can use a force push:

bash
Copy
Edit

git push origin main --force
